            Welcome!
            <br /><br />
            The old ctr4ever website is nearing it's 20th year of existence. It has served the community well and has been the go-to place for time trials
            within the CTR community for a really, really long time. However, the website has been showing it's age for quite a long time now and it was time for
            a change. The old website will continue to be available under <Link href="http://ctr4ever.joora.fr/home.php">this link</Link>, but it will slowly die out.
            <br /><br />
            The new website has many features that the old website didn't have, such as HTTPS, but the list is too long to put here. Explore the new website
            at your heart's content and check for yourself.
            <br /><br />
            One last word maybe on the time trial standards: As most players are aware, Justin's updated standards are pretty brutal and not a single
            player has a combined GOD ranking, with only Justin himself, Crash68 and Luca coming somewhat close. While the updated standards are better suited
            as a ranking due to higher variance, we felt that they were way too harsh to be useful for the absolute vast majority of the playerbase.
            <br /><br />
            The new website therefore contains a new set of standards: The modern standards. They are more foregiving and more leveraged while still reflecting
            the increased skill and better understanding of the game by the playerbase.
            <br />
            Maybe to some people's surprise, the modern standards do not incorporate lap skips or unconventional means of driving ('mbrugliament as the cool kids say).
            We hope that the modern standards encourage more players to improve their times and aim for the combined GOD standard.
